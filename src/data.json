        "customText[|As a follow-up to our discussion,|Thanks for your time.|I hope you are well.|Before our next appointment,|] I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the risk of early cardiorenal complications in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is associated with several micro and macrovascular complications that may start early in the disease process, of which cardiac and renal risks are prominent subtypes. The real-world data indicate that heart failure (HF) and/or chronic kidney disease(CKD) were the most common early cardiovascular (CV) complication in T2D patients â€“ higher than stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, the treatment guidelines such as European Association for the Study of Diabetes/ American Diabetes Association (EASD/ADA) and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines are evolving to consider the holistic management of T2D."
